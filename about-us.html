  <h2>Who Are We, And What Do We Do?</h2>
  <br>Kids 3D is a Start-Up Company run by kids that sells 3D printed products that you can choose and customize a 3D product for yourself. Keep in mind though, that customizing and choosing what you want will cost more, along with choosing some of our special materials.
  <br><h2>Why 3D printing?</h2>
  <br>There are multiple reasons we chose 3D printing such as although it's expensive once you have a 3D printer it's pretty cheap and easy not accounting for how long it takes, the second reason is because the founder already has a 3D printer so it was very convenient.
  <h2>Why start a bussiness at such a young age?</h2>
  <br>There are again multiple reasons to this, when you're a kid you have all the time in the world to do whatever you want so it's perfect to kickstart a bussiness, secondly it's just fun, it's really fun to run a bussiness when you're a kid cause the market's a lot less agressive and unforgiving, and lastly, it's a good learning opportunity, learnign how to determine worth and work and run a bussiness is a great learning opportunity esspecially for a kid who is still learning.
